            The online transformation service (powered by FME) provides a reference standard that
            enables software developers and spatial professionals to transform their data from the Geocentric
            Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94) to the Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (GDA2020). 
            Users can simply “drag and drop” files onto the page and receive an email with a link to download the
            output file.
            <br/><br/>
            Please note, this service is not intended to enable users to transform all their data from GDA94 to
            GDA2020; instead it aims to provide a method of checking systems and processes implemented by
            government or the spatial industry to ensure the transformation results are correct.
            The online transformation service accepts the following formats at this time: Shapefiles, CSV, ASCII Grid,
            GeoTiff, ECW, JPEG2000, GeoJSON

         <h3 style="clear:both">Choice of Transformation Grid</h3>
         Two different transformation grids are provided for you to choose from:
         <ul>
            <li>Conformal</li>
            <li>Conformal and Distortion</li>
         </ul>
         <strong>Conformal grid:</strong> predominantly plate tectonic motion (~1.7 m NNE) and replicates a seven-parameter
         similarity transformation.
         <br/>
         <i>NOTE: If GDA94 coordinates were observed using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
         technology, with corrections coming from a network of GNSS reference stations (such as GPSnet,
         CORSnet-NSW), it is likely that the coordinates will be unaffected by local distortions. In this case, the
         Conformal grid or a seven-parameter similarity transformation would be most suitable to transform the
         GDA94 coordinates to GDA2020.</i>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <strong>Conformal and Distortion grid:</strong> plate tectonic motion and regional distortion caused by an improved
         realisation of the global reference frame over time; irregular ground movement since GDA94 was
         established; and improvements in computation methods since GDA94. These effects vary in magnitude
         and direction around the country and can be as large as ~0.5 m.
         <br/>
         <i>NOTE: If survey control marks were used for referencing and/or establishing GDA94 coordinates,
         localised distortion will need to be taken into account. In this case, the Conformal and Distortion grid
         should be used to transform to GDA2020 coordinates. If in doubt, contact your state or territory land
         survey authority.</i>
